    "# Challenge 3: To practice - Constructing Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "While testing our hypothesis is a great way to gather empirical evidence for accepting or rejecting the hypothesis, another way to gather evidence is by creating a confidence interval. A confidence interval gives us information about the true mean of the population. So for a 95% confidence interval, we are 95% sure that the mean of the population is within the confidence interval. \n",

    "In the cell below, we will construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean hourly wage of all hourly workers. \n",

    "The confidence interval is computed in SciPy using the `t.interval` function. You can read more about this function [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.t.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the confidence interval of the hourly wage, use the 0.95 for the confidence level, number of rows - 1 for degrees of freedom, the mean of the sample for the location parameter and the standard error for the scale. The standard error can be computed using [this](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.sem.html) function in SciPy."

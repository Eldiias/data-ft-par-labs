## Project Description
I chose this game because I understand the basic principles of Blackjack.  So it seemed it would be a good way to see how to make it into a game.  

## Rules
-Score total of 21 wins.  Anything above will count as a loss.
-Each player is dealt 2 cards to start. One of the dealer cards is a mystery.
-Based on the dealers showing card the player has to decide if they want to 'hit' or 'stay'


## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
-we used trello
-researched the game
-designed the game structure
-coded the game
-added error handling
-tested the game

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
-The repo is organized with the .gitignore file, the game blackjack and the readme.md.
